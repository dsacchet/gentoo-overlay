*servertools-1.3.2 (04 Jan 2006)

  04 Jan 2006; Denis Sacchet <ouba@ouba.org> :
  Initial import.  Ebuild submitted by submitter_name <submitter_email>.
  Note that the "changed_file" listing is optional if you are simply bumping
  the rev of the ebuild and are only making changes to the .ebuild file
  itself.  Also note that we now have a single unified paragraph rather than
  having the first line separated from the rest by a newline.  Everything
  should be in one block like this. (note by drobbins, 16 Jul 2002)

  DD MMM YYYY; YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL> changed_file1, changed_file2: this is
  an earlier ChangeLog entry.
